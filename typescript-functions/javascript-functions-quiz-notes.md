## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  the function keyword, the optional function name, the parameters encased in parethesis followed by the curly braces which incase the optional return statement
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the function is first called by using its name, and then invoked by applying the parenthesis with its arguments inside.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function call does not use the function keyword and instead of placeholders as parameters it uses actual values or arguments
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter is a placeholder, an argument has an actual value
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  because they allow for flexibility and reusability
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it will return the function action, it also serves to execute the function from running
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  the => and the intentional missing function keyword

  it is treated as a return statement
